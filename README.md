# Vue3 Tailwind Daisy Starter

This starter template helps me quickly build a simple frontend website, primarily using Vue3 & Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Daisy as the main components.

It also utilizes Eslint & Prettier and comes pre-configured with some basic settings, saving time on initial project setup and configuration.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```
